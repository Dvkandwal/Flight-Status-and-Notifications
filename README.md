Flight Status and Notifications System
This project is a full-stack application that provides real-time flight status updates and notifications to passengers. The system allows users to view the current status of flights, receive notifications for changes, and subscribe to updates via email, SMS, or app notifications.

Features
Real-time Updates: Displays current flight status, including delays, cancellations, and gate changes.
Push Notifications: Sends notifications for flight status changes via SMS, email, or app notifications.
Integration with Airport Systems: Pulls data from airport databases for accurate information (using mock data in this implementation).
Technologies Used
Frontend
HTML
CSS
JavaScript (Vanilla JS or React.js, depending on implementation)
Backend
Python (Flask)
PostgreSQL (for structured data)
MongoDB (for unstructured data)
Message Brokers: Kafka/RabbitMQ (for handling notifications)
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python (3.6 or higher)
Node.js (if using npm for frontend dependencies)
PostgreSQL
MongoDB
Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd flight-status-backend
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up PostgreSQL:

Start PostgreSQL and create a database and tables as needed.
Set up MongoDB:

Start MongoDB and set up collections.
Run the backend server:

bash
Copy code
export FLASK_APP=app.py  # On Windows, use `set FLASK_APP=app.py`
flask run
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd flight-status-frontend
Install dependencies (if using a package manager like npm):

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Usage
Access the Application:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or the deployed URL) to access the frontend.
The backend API is accessible at http://localhost:5000/api.
View Flight Status:

The home page displays a table of flights with their current status, gate number, and other details.
Subscribe to Notifications:

Users can subscribe to notifications by providing their email or phone number.
Testing
Backend
Run tests for the Flask API using pytest or any preferred testing framework.
Ensure that all endpoints and data flows work correctly.
Frontend
Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library for testing frontend components (if applicable).
Deployment
Backend
Deploy the Flask backend on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
Set up PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases on the cloud.
Frontend
Deploy the frontend on Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
Environment Variables
Database Credentials: Store PostgreSQL and MongoDB credentials securely.
API Keys: If using third-party services for notifications (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid), store API keys securely.
